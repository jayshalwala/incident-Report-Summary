# ICMP Flood DDoS Incident Response Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive incident response analysis for a simulated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack via ICMP flooding against a multimedia company’s internal network. The analysis follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and documents the security event, the response actions taken, and recommended improvements.

### Repository Contents
- `incident-summary.md` – Executive summary of the DDoS incident  
- `nist-csf-analysis.md` – Detailed NIST CSF alignment (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)  
- `recommendations.md` – Strategic plan to enhance network security posture  

## How to Use
1. Review `incident-summary.md` for a concise overview of the security event.  
2. Examine `nist-csf-analysis.md` for a structured CSF-based analysis.  
3. Consult `recommendations.md` for prioritized security improvements.
