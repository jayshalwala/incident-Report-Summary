# NIST CSF Analysis

## Identify
- Conduct regular network audits to detect unfiltered protocols.
- Review firewall configuration and rule sets for gaps.

## Protect
- Implement firewall rules to rate-limit ICMP traffic.
- Enforce source IP verification to prevent spoofing.
- Define and document ICMP handling policies.

## Detect
- Deploy network monitoring tools to flag abnormal traffic volumes.
- Configure IDS/IPS to detect and alert on ICMP flood signatures.

## Respond
- Develop playbooks for DDoS scenarios: isolate affected segments, restore services, and collect forensic data.
- Establish incident reporting procedures to management and legal authorities.

## Recover
- Restore network services in tiers: critical first, then non-critical.
- Validate normal traffic patterns before re-enabling services.
- Conduct post-incident review and update recovery plans accordingly.
