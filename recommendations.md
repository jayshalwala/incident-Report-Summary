# Recommendations

To strengthen network security and mitigate future DDoS threats:

1. **Firewall Hardening**  
   - Enforce rate-limiting rules for ICMP and other flooding vectors.  
   - Implement geo-filtering and blacklisting of suspicious IP ranges.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**  
   - Deploy advanced network traffic analytics and anomaly detection.  
   - Integrate real-time alerts from IDS/IPS and monitoring systems.

3. **Incident Preparedness**  
   - Develop and rehearse DDoS response playbooks.  
   - Maintain a tiered service restoration plan.

4. **Capacity Planning**  
   - Invest in DDoS mitigation services (cloud-based scrubbing).  
   - Ensure sufficient network bandwidth and redundancy.

5. **Continuous Improvement**  
   - Schedule periodic reviews of firewall and IDS/IPS configurations.  
   - Incorporate lessons learned into security policies and training.
